-- 0005 — put the offer tables back into the Realtime publication
--
-- The app moved from `cashback_rates` to `cashback_offers` /
-- `point_offers` / `gift_card_offers` in May 2026. The publication that
-- feeds Supabase Realtime never moved with it, because nothing in this
-- repo managed it — it was set once by hand in the dashboard, against
-- the old schema, and stayed there. Before this migration it carried:
--
--   cashback_rates (17 rows), offers (0), reward_options (0),
--   rate_history (0), strategy_results (0), user_simulations (0),
--   stores, miles_programs, user_cards
--
-- Four of those are empty and none of them is a table the live app
-- subscribes to. Meanwhile `useStoreOffers` (src/hooks/useCatalog.js)
-- subscribes to the three offer tables and `useSubscription`
-- (src/hooks/useSubscription.js) subscribes to `user_profiles`.
-- Postgres never published those, so `subscribe()` returned SUBSCRIBED
-- and not one event was ever emitted. No error anywhere — which is why
-- it survived five months.
--
-- REPLICA IDENTITY FULL is not optional here. The frontend subscribes
-- with `filter: store_id=eq.<id>`, and for DELETE the old row reaches
-- Realtime carrying only the replica identity. Under the default
-- (primary key) identity, `store_id` is absent, the filter cannot
-- match, and the delete is dropped. FULL is also what lets Realtime
-- evaluate the RLS policy against the old row. These five tables all
-- have a primary key and the largest is 5 MB, so the extra WAL volume
-- is small — but it IS extra WAL on every UPDATE, and the daily
-- ingestion rewrites a few thousand rows of cashback_offers, so it is
-- worth watching after this lands.
--
-- Order matters: set the replica identity BEFORE adding the table to
-- the publication, never the other way round.
--
-- Rollback:
--   alter publication supabase_realtime drop table
--     public.cashback_offers, public.point_offers,
--     public.gift_card_offers, public.user_profiles, public.hot_deals;
--   alter table public.cashback_offers  replica identity default;  -- etc.
