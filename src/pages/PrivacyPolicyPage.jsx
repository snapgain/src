            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              UK GDPR Article 6 requires us to identify a lawful basis for each
              processing activity:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
              <li>
                <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): to
                provide the service you signed up for — account creation,
                login, subscription management, delivering features you paid
                for.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): product
                analytics, abuse prevention, fixing bugs, attribution. Balanced
                against your privacy by anonymising where possible and never
                selling data.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): non-essential cookies
                (analytics, attribution) and marketing emails. You can withdraw
                consent at any time in Settings or via the cookie banner.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)): tax records,
                accounting records, and responding to lawful regulator requests.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">4. Who processes your data on our behalf</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We use vetted third parties to run the service. Each is a "data
              processor" under UK GDPR and has its own privacy commitments:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
              <li>
                <strong>Supabase</strong> (database + authentication + email
                delivery). Hosted in the EU (Ireland, eu-west-2).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vercel</strong> (web hosting + static assets + CDN).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Stripe</strong> (payment processing + subscription
                billing). PCI-DSS certified; we never see your card numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Resend</strong> (transactional + digest emails). Stores
                send logs for deliverability monitoring.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sentry</strong> (error tracking). We disable PII capture
                by default — only your user ID is attached to error reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Google Analytics 4</strong> (aggregate usage analytics).
                Loaded only after you accept analytics cookies. IP
                anonymisation enabled; no advertising cookies.
              </li>

                <strong>hCaptcha</strong> (signup bot protection). EU-based
                alternative to reCAPTCHA, no Google tracking.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Affiliate networks</strong> (TopCashback, Quidco,
                Awin-style partners) — when you click through to a partner site
                they place their own cookies. We don't see your purchases,
                only the fact that a click happened.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Most of our infrastructure runs in the EU (Supabase eu-west-2 in
              Ireland). Some processors (Stripe, Sentry, Google Analytics,
              Vercel) are US-headquartered and may process data outside the
              UK/EU. Where they do, the transfer relies on Standard
              Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the EU–US Data Privacy Framework,
              both recognised by the UK and EU as providing adequate safeguards.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3">9. Children</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              SnapGain is not directed at children. We do not knowingly
              collect personal data from anyone under 18. If you believe a
              child has provided us data, contact us and we'll delete it.
              Account holders must be 18 or older because the service involves
              financial decisions and payment processing.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              We use industry-standard security: TLS in transit, row-level
              security on the database, hashed passwords, JWT-based
              authentication, optional 2-factor authentication, and quarantine
              of leaked credentials via Have I Been Pwned. No system is 100%
              secure; if a breach affects your data we will notify the ICO
              within 72 hours (UK GDPR Art. 33) and you directly if the
              breach is likely to result in high risk to you (Art. 34).

              Optional product emails like the daily boost digest are sent
              with your consent and can be turned off any time in Settings,
